# TrashQuest
Just out of the lab version
Trash Quest has been created during a 2 weeks Android Lab during my developper training. 
It's goal is to help the Brusseleirs (people living in one of the 19 cities composing Brussels) 
being more comfortable with recycling rules and also to give the nearest point for special trashes like glass, fabric, batteries etc...

To make it work you have to enter one of Brussels's zip code (1000, 1050, 1080, 1060, 1050, 1030, 1040, 1070, 1081, 1082, 1083, 1090, 
1140, 1150, 1160, 1170, 1180, 1190, 1200, 1210)
